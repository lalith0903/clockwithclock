# ⏰ ClockWithClocks

**ClockWithClocks** is a visually engaging web project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that showcases multiple clocks in a single interface. It demonstrates real-time time updates, clean UI design, and core JavaScript date/time handling concepts.

This project is ideal for beginners and intermediate developers looking to understand how real-time clocks work on the web using pure frontend technologies.

## ⚙️ How It Works

* JavaScript’s `Date()` object is used to fetch the current time.
* Time updates automatically every second using `setInterval()`.
* CSS handles visual presentation and clock styling.
* HTML provides a simple and semantic structure for the clocks.
